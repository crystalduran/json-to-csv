## JSON to CSV

### Project Idea

This project is based on the JSON2CSV App idea from Florin Pop's "App Ideas" [repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/JSON2CSV-App.md). I decided to take on this beginner-level project to practice and demonstrate my skills in handling basic data manipulation tasks. The simplicity of this project allows me to focus on core concepts while building a useful tool for converting JSON data into CSV format.

### Objective

The objective of JSON2CSV is to help bridge the gap between JSON and CSV formats, enabling users to easily convert JSON data into a CSV file for better accessibility and organization. Users can paste their JSON data into a text box and generate its equivalent CSV, making it easier to review and analyze the data in spreadsheet software.

### Features

- [x] User can paste JSON syntax into a text box.
- [x] User can click a 'Convert' button to validate the JSON and convert it to CSV.
- [x] User can see the converted CSV in a separate text box.
- [x] User will see a warning message if the JSON is empty or invalid.
- [x] User can click a 'Clear' button to clear both the JSON and CSV text boxes.
